# FortConsole

A DLL that creates the UE4 console.

Specifically made for the latest version of Fortnite, so may not work for other games.

Make sure to launch without anti-cheat to avoid being banned.

Any DLL injector should work if launched without anti-cheat.

All CheatManager/FortCheatManager functions have been stripped from the game, so popular commands like ``toggledebugcamera`` and ``summon`` will not work.

Be careful when using ``showdebug`` as it lags the game due to not being able to find a font.
